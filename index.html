					Code the Dream offers free intensive training in software
					development to people from diverse low-income backgrounds.
					In CTD Labs, our coders work with experienced mentors to
					hone those skills by building apps and technology platforms
					for a range of startups, nonprofits and government clients.
					The ultimate aim of Code the Dream is to create a unique
					win-win, where our coders gain real experience building apps
					that make the world a little better place, and then use that
					experience to launch new careers with enormous opportunity
					for themselves, their families, and their communities.
